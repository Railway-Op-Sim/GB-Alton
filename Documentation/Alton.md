# Alton

Alton is a terminus station at the end of the Alton Main Line. It is served by South Western Railway services from London Waterloo, and acts as a connection to the Watercress Line Heritage Railway. This simulation includes the area around Alton station, and the Alton Main Line up to Pirbright Junction with the South Western Main Line. It also includes part of the line from Aldershot towards Ascot.

## Simulation

A timetable for 29 June 2022 has been included, running from 04:20 until the last train of the evening, at approximately 1am. The standard services are:

- 2tph London Waterloo to Alton
- 2tph Guildford to Farnham
- 2tph Ascot to Aldershot

All services are operated by South Western Railway.

These services combine to give a frequency of 6 trains per hour at Aldershot, making the line rather busy. Additional peak time services operate on various routes, and some Railhead Treatment Trains (headcode FRGT) operate throughout the day. The Watercress Line timetable has also been included for Alton station, providing more trains to control there.

## Operational Tips

Keep an eye on passing times of each train. While through most of the day one train arrives at Alton before the other departs, sometimes (particularly in peak hours) they pass at Bentley instead.

A session file has been included in the download - it is advisable to use this rather than using the "preset automatic routes button", as one of the automatic routes in the Farnham area prevents some routes required for the timetable to operate correctly from being set.
